## Playing Card Classifier using PyTorch

This project is a simple PyTorch-based image classifier for recognizing standard playing cards from images. It uses a Kaggle dataset and explores data preprocessing, model training using pretrained vision architectures, and visualizing model performance.

### Overview

* Uses **PyTorch** and **Torchvision** for deep learning workflows
* Employs **pretrained CNN models** via the `timm` library
* Visualizes predictions, labels, and class mappings
